I usually talk in french, but you must respond in english to avoid technical term confusion.

I want to build a frontend webapp with ReactJS. We use typescript over javascript almost everywhere.
It is deployed on Netlify, not at all on Vercel with React Server Components

For regular React component, ALAWAYS prefer export named component over default component, except if there is a good
reasons
imposed by a framework.

Components are made with react, typescript, SCSS, tailwind and DaisyUI.

I will give requirement, with a number, such as : R-FOUNDATION-21
Do one requirement at a time, except if I give in the current prompt multiple ones.
Don't anticipate the further requirements

Add these requirements in comments when it makes sens.

## UNit test

Usee vitest, and always import the needed imports:

import { expect, describe, it } from 'vitest'

Name the test files as component.spec.tsx or file.spec.ts
Put the file and the testfile in the same directory

After touching typescript file, compile to check, then run the unit test with npm test

Ideally, each component should have at least one test file, even for simple components.

We want to test the behavior of the component, when the user interact with it.

## Storybook

After creating a component, create a storybook file for it.
Storybook files are named as Component.stories.tsx and are put in :

- src/stories/low for low level components such as buttons, inputs, modals, etc
- src/stories/high for high level components such as pages, complex components
- src/stories/mid for components like specialized cards, lists, TopBar, etc

### types

For files describing types, use a .type.ts extension

For example, providers.types.ts
